# Moer: Research Oriented Physically Based Renderer

![build](https://github.com/NJUCG/Moer/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

Moer is a phycially based renderer, providing an "easy to deploy and develop" rendering platform for computer vision (CV) and computer graphics (CG) research.

Moer is developed by NJUMeta (www.njumeta.com) from Nanjing University.

## Features

- Easy to deploy, "install & clone & make & run"
- Structured scene description using `json`
- Interface for integrator/medium/bxdf/texture... and some pre-set implementions
- Unworried resource management for heavy resource (image/mesh)
